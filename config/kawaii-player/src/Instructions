In some distributions more dependencies might be required which are listed below

('python3-livestreamer' 'python3-libtorrent' 'python3-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5' 'python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit')

Name of dependencies may vary from distro to distro. 

First Remove or uninstall any other version of the AnimeWatch. After uninstall either backup or remove '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src' directory, since it might contain incompatible Addons or plugins, because of which programme might not work.

Make sure qt5-webengine is installed. If qt5-webengine is not packaged in your linux distro then it will fallback to qtwebkit.

Now In the 'AnimeWatch-PyQt5' directory open a terminal and run 'python install.py'. Now application launcher should be created in '~/.local/share/applications/' directory. If application launcher is not working, then directly go to '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src' directory, open terminal and run 'python3 -B animeWatch.py'.

If you don't want't to run 'install.py' script, then you can simply use './animewatch-start' bash script to launch the player directly from within the source folder without copying installation files anywhere on the system. If you are using 'animewatch-start' script then you need to copy manually contents of 'Plugins' folder to the destination '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src/Plugins/' in order to use addons. If there is no default background then copy 'default.jpg' to '~/.config/AnimeWatch' and '1.png' to '~/.config/AnimeWatch/src/'
